# YOLO Object Detection Streamlit App

This is a simple object detection app built using the YOLOv8 model and Streamlit. It allows users to detect objects in real-time using a webcam or by uploading images. The app processes the input image or video, detects objects, and displays both the bounding boxes and class names of the detected objects.

## Features
- **Webcam Object Detection**: Stream real-time video from your webcam and detect objects.
- **Image Upload Detection**: Upload an image and detect objects present in the image.
- **YOLOv8 Model**: Utilizes the lightweight YOLOv8 model for fast object detection.
- **Detected Object Information**: Displays the detected objects with bounding box coordinates, class name, and confidence score.
